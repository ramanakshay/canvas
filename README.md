# Canvas ☯︎

> "Beauty is as important in computing as it is in painting or architecture." — Donald E. Knuth

A simple, flexible, and modular template for your deep learning projects using PyTorch and Hydra. Inspired by the agent-environment interface, Canvas aims to provide a unified template for all ML projects.

## Available Templates

Canvas offers unique templates to kickstart various machine learning tasks:

* **Supervised Learning (SL):** Perfect for tasks like classification and regression, where you have labeled data.

* **Reinforcement Learning (RL):**  Designed for building agents that learn by interacting with an environment.

* **Self-Supervised Learning (SSL):** Train models to learn representations from unlabeled data.

## Installation

Canvas requires **Python 3.9+**. Since it's a command-line tool, we highly recommend using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for installation

```
# Recommended: with uv tool
uv tool install canvas-template

# Alternative: with pip
pip install canvas-template
```

## Usage

To create a new project, just run the `canvas init` command and pick your template. No need to create a directory first; Canvas will do it for you.

```
canvas init [sl|ssl|rl]
```

**Example:** The following settings will create a project named *my_project* with the self-supervised learning (SSL) template.

## Project Structure

The directory structure of your new project will look something like this (depending on the settings that you choose):

```
example-project/
├── Makefile                # Useful commands for development
├── LICENSE                 # Project license

## Contributing

Any kind of enhancement or contribution is welcomed. If you have bug fixes, new features, or any improvements, I'd love your help!

### TODOs

- [ ] Support for loggers (wandb, tensorboard)
- [ ] Distributed training integration (ddp, accelerator, etc.)
